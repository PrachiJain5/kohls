        <h1>Medical and Prescription Drug Coverage</h1>
        <p>You can choose from three medical plans&mdash;the Basic Plan, Savers Plan and Exclusive Provider Plan. The plans have many similar features. For example, they:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cover the <strong>same services</strong> (like physician office visits, hospital and outpatient services and emergency room visits).</li>
          <li>
            <p>Use the <strong>same provider networks</strong> (Anthem or UnitedHealthcare, depending on where you work).</p>
            <h4>UnitedHealthcare</h4>
            <p>You’ll get the most value when you choose UnitedHealthcare network doctors. As long as you receive care from a UHC network provider, you’ll receive the higher in-network coinsurance level. However, you’re encouraged to seek care from UHC network providers that are recognized as top-rated for both quality and cost-effectiveness. <span class="text-dkblue"><strong>These doctors are designated as “Tier 1,” so be sure to look for the UnitedHealthcare Premium Tier 1 symbol when you search for in-network providers.</strong></span></p>
            <img src="img/icon-tier-1.jpg" class="img-responsive img50" alt=""/><br>
            <h4>Anthem</h4>
            <p>If you’re covered by Anthem, you’ll receive a higher benefit for using Anthem&rsquo;s network of top-rated facilities for the following very specialized conditions: bariatric surgery, cardiac care, knee/hip replacement, spine surgery and transplants. Anthem designates these facilities as <em>Anthem Blue Distinction Center</em> + facilities.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Cover <strong>in-network preventive care</strong> (like annual physicals, well woman exams and checkups for your dependent children) <strong>at 100%</strong> with no deductible.</li>
          <li><strong>Provide financial protection</strong> in the event of a serious illness or injury.</li>
        </ul>

                      <p><strong>Note</strong>: There are <em>separate</em> in-network and out-of-network deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums</p>

                      <p>While you have the ability to use any provider you choose, using in-network providers saves you money. That’s because in-network providers have agreed to lower, negotiated rates for most services.</p>
